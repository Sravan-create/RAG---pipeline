# RAG---pipeline
Simple RAG with LangChain and Ollama (LLaMA 2) This project demonstrates a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain. It loads text from a file and a web page, embeds them with HuggingFace, stores them in FAISS, and answers questions using LLaMA 2 via Ollama.
